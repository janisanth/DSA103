# Lecture 8: Exploratory Data Analysis using ML

You have seen EDA in practice and tried on the wine dataset. Now it is time to expand your toolkit and practice with some ML models. You can find the lecture material for both lectures 7 and 8 in the new "EDA-lectures-7-8" folder under "src".


## Tasks

- Apply the contents of the lecture to the wine dataset that you already used for manual EDA.
- Write a Python script that applies a linear regression model, a decision tree and a random forest to the wine data set. 
- Include a PCA, rerun the ML models and compare the results.
- You can extend the script that you prepared in exercise 7 or start afresh using again the same template (https://github.com/schoergj/DSA103/tree/main/EDA-lectures-7-8/scripts) or in your cloned fork ;)
- Make sure that the scripts has an organised structure and features clear comments. It should provide console output for the summary stats and save pictures of the plots as png.
- Make sure to push your work to your Repository.


## Interpretation 

Interpret the results and take into account what you already learned from your manual EDA.
